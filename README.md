# Stroke Classification Neural Network

This project aimed to create a Convolutional Neural Network used to detect ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes from Computer Tomography scans. The model was trained and tested using two pre-labeled datasets gathered from publically available databases. The preliminary results found an overall accuracy of 89.6% with an overall AUC value for all positive stroke cases found to be 0.78. This study showed promising results that may be improved in the future through increased training and testing data.
